MIMIC-IV is available for all credentialed researchers. Access is through [Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv). Check out the [documentation](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu) for more details.
</p>

It can be hard to find data available to conduct research, more so a single source containing all the information you might need. If you want your research to be completely reproducible, your search is then reduced to a handful of publicly available databases. MIMIC-III was for long the single source of public data from Intensive Care Units. But what happens when your article is not accepted for publication in a journal because said database was considered "old data"?

**You ~~cry~~ download MIMIC-IV.**

But really, we have developed the brand new MIMIC to be much more than just up-to-date information.

So let's dive in and see what it is all about.

&nbsp;  
## The all *new* data

In the third version of MIMIC, there were two different systems from which the ICU data was sourced, *carevue* and *metavision*. This occurred due to a change in the ICU system during the data collection period. A core principle of sharing the data was distributing it "as-is" to reflect real clinical data. As a result, we had different representations of the same clinical concept depending on the date a patient was admitted.

Now, if you have worked with MIMIC-III, you probably know all about the pains of wrangling data from the two systems and you have your own grudge with *carevue*. You might have even given up more recently and excluded carevue patients altogheter from your study. Indeed, all the work might not be worth considering carevue admissions happened 13-20 years ago.

After executing a carefully plotted vendetta, we have finally **dropped *carevue***. Now, the available data from the ICU is acquired only from *metavision*. Having a single source of data simplifies data extraction considerable. Considering that we are now including data up to **2019 (yay!)**, *metavision* will award us with *11 years* of data.

<div style="margin: 25px 75px;"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet mx-auto"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MIMIC-IV is public! ~70,000 ICU stays, deidentified, ready for research. It&#39;s only 7 GB! ... but with &gt;300 million charted observations, there&#39;s a lot to dig through. Quick thread on the highlights. <a href="https://t.co/N6Rzrrkjxg">https://t.co/N6Rzrrkjxg</a></p>&mdash; Alistair Johnson (@alistairewj) <a href="https://twitter.com/alistairewj/status/1295406346788012035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

So what does it mean to have more recent data available?

**Things change, and so does the standard of care**. Having up-to-date information will allow studies to include the most current treatments into their analysis, better reflecting contemporary clinical practice. Ventilation practices have markedly changed over the past 15 years, all for the better, and MIMIC-IV opens the door to improving even further.

&nbsp;  
## Actual year included

... plus or minus a bit.

From comparing the changes in outcome according to the availability of new treatments, being able to select patients in a period in which a specific drug was most recommended, or even including only the most recent admissions. Tell us, *what is it you truly desire?* 

For any number of studies, knowing when a patient was admitted tells you a lot. What treatments were standard of practice? Were there drug shortages? Did we redefine the diagnostic criteria? Over and over, we found researchers wanted information on when the patient was admitted. Sharing real dates would very seriously break the deidentification, certainly a HIPAA violation, but more importantly an unacceptable risk to the very patients we seek to help. Historically, MIMIC-III kept the day of the week and season consistent with the real information, and removed the rest. It was clear at the time how useful day of the week and season could be, but no one suspected how long the MIMIC project would actually carry on. Fast forward to today, and with 11 years of data, the equation changes. While we can argue about which is more important, the fact is, they can't both be included. For MIMIC-IV, we've changed tack.

**MIMIC-IV has the *approximate* year of a patient's first admission**. 

We'll see how this looks in a bit.

&nbsp;  
## MIMIC in flavors

**We have big plans for MIMIC**, and they don't fit in one dataset.

Now, MIMIC has multiple modules: CORE, HOSP, ED, ICU, and CXR.

Luckily, we have built a nice diagram that shows us which step of patient care each module corresponds to:

![](/assets/images/mimic-iv-available/mimic-diagram.jpg)
<p style="font-size: .8em; padding: 0 15px;" markdown="1">
MIMIC flavors. *Core* has patient demographics and tracking. ED has information about the patient's evaluation at the emergency room. *ICU* contains data from the intensive care systems and devices. *Hosp* has data shared between different units, such as labs, microbiology, and medications.
</p>


The aim is for greater transparency on the type and source of the data, with the additional flexibility to only use the data you need. Let's dig in.

#### MIMIC-Core

It is as the name says, the core of MIMIC. It has information that is necessary to navigate any and across all the MIMIC flavors.

The interactions of every health system begin with the **patient**. They are feeling unwell, seek care and if necessary, treatment. In the case that the patient goes to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's emergency room or is referred there by a physician, they will start their interaction with the system from which MIMIC collects its data.

Throughout their hospital **admission**, the patient might need to be seen in a number of hospital wards for different purposes. These changes in a patient's location inside the hospital are referred to as **transfers**, and they're basically administrative footprints.

**patients, admissions, and transfers**.

Let's start with the **patient**.

`subject_id` | `anchor_age` | `anchor_year` | `anchor_year_group`
--- | --- | --- | ---
10014729 | 21 | 2125 | 2011 - 2013

<p style="font-size: .8em; padding: 0 15px; margin-top: 10px;" markdown="1">
Partial view on the **patients** table showing patient 10014729.
</p>

Here, `subject_id` identifies a single patient. Across all MIMIC modules, `subject_id` is consistent, and enables data linkage. Here we will follow patient 10014729.

You might have noticed we have two *year* fields here, and their age. Recall for deidentification all the MIMIC dates occur at some far off point in the future.

- The earliest year into which the patient's data were shifted is available in `anchor_year`.
- `anchor_age` is simply the age of the patient in the `anchor_year`, with a small amount of noise added.
- `anchor_year_group` corresponds to the approximate real year of their first admission in the database.

Using the example patient, it means that:

- The first year 10014729 had an encounter in MIMIC was 2125.
- They were 21 years old in 2125.
- For this patient, the fictional year of 2125 corresponds to one of the three years from 2011 to 2013.

Hopefully not too hard.

Now, on to **admissions**.

`subject_id` | `hadm_id` | `edregtime` | `edouttime`
--- | --- | --- | ---
10014729 | 28889419 |  | 
10014729 | 23300884 | 2125-03-19T12:36:00 | 2125-03-19T18:45:00

<p style="font-size: .8em; padding: 0 15px; margin-top: 10px;" markdown="1">

`subject_id` | `hadm_id` | `admittime` | `dischtime`
--- | --- | --- | ---
10014729 | 28889419 | 2125-02-27T07:15:00 | 2125-03-06T14:25:00
10014729 | 23300884 | 2125-03-19T16:58:00 | 2125-03-28T13:37:00

<p style="font-size: .8em; padding: 0 15px; margin-top: 10px;" markdown="1">
Partial view on the **admissions** table highlighting admission times for patient 10014729.
</p>

Here we can see that our example patient has been admitted to the hospital twice in February 27th and March 19th of 2125, and their second admission was preceded by a visit to the emergency room. The months and days are entirely fictional and shouldn't be used in analysis, but the relative *interval* is correct, i.e. the patient really did have a 30-day readmission to the hospital.

If you carefully examine that admission, you will notice that `admittime` i.e. the time the patient was admitted to the hospital, happens before `edouttime`. But wait, how can a patient be in two places?

Well, the ED and the hospital where the data are collected use different systems. The timing information provided, particularly on transfers, is not always precise.

As we said previously, we always try to publish the dataset as close as possible to the source data. Fixing this is not trivial, and it requires a substantial amount of data wrangling and data quality checks. We didn't want you to be unaware of that, so in the admissions table, we just provide you with the data as is.

But we are very appreciative of our users, and know that even if they were to put in the work to fix this, they wouldn't be able to check the quality of their work. So, we have worked to provide you with consistent timing information, putting a lot of effort to make sure it was as close to reality as possible. We provide that information in the **transfers** table, so let's look into it.

`hadm_id` | `transfer_id` | `intime` | `outtime`
--- | --- | --- | ---
23300884 | 37887480 | 2125-03-19T12:36:00 | 2125-03-19T16:59:47	
23300884 | 37471901 | 2125-03-19T16:59:47 | 2125-03-19T17:06:15
23300884 | 35959158 | 2125-03-19T17:06:15 | 2125-03-20T10:39:52
... | ... | ... | ...
23300884 | 33082827 | 2125-03-23T17:15:22 | 2125-03-28T13:44:57
23300884 | 33058230 | 2125-03-28T13:44:57 |

</p>

Here, you can see the times are aligned, each `intime` being the exact same as the `outtime` of the patient's last location. This table is straightforward, every change in the patient's location is recorded here. Things to note:

- For emergency room visits, the `eventtype` will always be set to "ED".
- The row for a patient's hospital admission will have the `eventtype` set to `admit`
- The row for a patient's hospital discharge will only have an `intime` (i.e. they are "transferred" to outside the hospital at that time), and the `eventtype` will be "discharge".
- Any other change in the patient's location will have `eventtype` "transfer".

#### MIMIC-ICU

With all monitoring, procedures, fluid balance, and other information collected routinelly in the intensive care unit, MIMIC-ICU includes the following tables: `chartevents`,  `d_items`, `datetimeevents`, `icustays`, `inputevents`, `outputevents`, and `procedureevents`. It is basically the same critical care unit data that was present on MIMIC-III, but without *carevue*.

Here's a summary of changes:

- `icustay_id` is approximately equivalent `stay_id`. This was changed because we plan to release identifiers for stays other than ICU. Importantly, `stay_id` *does not merge ICU stays in a 24 hour period*. This enables analysis of ICU readmissions, but it does complicate analysis of patients with incorrect transfer information (sometimes the documentation in `transfers` is implausible, e.g. 3 minute ward stays in the middle of an ICU stay).
- there's only a single inputevents table now, identical to `inputevents_mv` which was in MIMIC-III (and sourced from *metavision*).
- d_items: `itemid` values are the same between MIMIC III and IV, except for new items that are introduced in MIMIC-IV. `itemid` which referred to *carevue* items do not exist in MIMIC-IV.

We are confident that the removal of *carevue* will greatly simplify your research!

#### MIMIC-ED

#### MIMIC-CXR

<p style="font-size: .8em; padding: 0 15px;" markdown="1">
MIMIC-IV provides remarkable oportunities by providing information from medication administration and monitoring equipment, clinician notes, chest x-rays, and much more.
</p>

MIMIC-IV and [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/) use the same subject identifiers, and are implicitly linked. You can analyze full resolution chest x-rays with their corresponding clinical data. Unprecedented opportunities in multimodal data analysis here.

#### MIMIC-Hosp

All the information that is collected by the hospital-wide systems - what we refer to *hospital-level data* - is in MIMIC-Hosp. That includes microbiology, diagnoses, laboratory results, procedures, and medication information.

Compared to MIMIC-III, some changes occurred to vocabularies. The `cptevents` table was replaced with `hcpcsevents`. Also, because of the change in the ICD version used by the hospital during the time period of MIMIC-IV, ICD-10 codes are introduced in the data in addition to the ICD-9 codes that were already included in the previous version.

But that's not all here, there are also some new awesome and exciting additions to MIMIC-Hosp.

One of them is the inclusion of more non-patient identifiers. For example, in `microbiologyevents` and `labevents`, you can use the brand new `specimen_id`s to track results that were obtained from the same patient sample. Blood gases have never been so easy to group! For microbiology, you can also track relations between specimens, tests, organisms, and antibiotics.

The biggest addition to hospital-level data is the additional medication information, including highly granular medication administration data.

&nbsp;  
## Medications

Studying the effect of various treatments is a burgeoning field of retrospective observational research. MIMIC-III was no exception, though it could be hard to infer from the database when a patient was receiveing a given treatment, as only intravenous medications were routinely documented. Enter the electronic Medicine Administration Record (eMAR).

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Efozfq3XYAA6zMm?format=jpg&name=small)
<p style="font-size: .8em; padding: 0 15px;" markdown="1">
eMAR is now included and provides more precise information about the drugs being administered.
</p>

Bedside staff will scan barcodes for each individual formulary unit of a medication when administering it. This allows for a granular, high resolution record of when a medication was given. eMAR, while a rich and excellent source of information, was only recently implemented and as such roughly half of the patients in MIMIC-IV have eMAR data. Not to fear: the prescriptions table has been upgraded from MIMIC-III. All start and stop dates have been augmented with the time of day, and the time at which the prescription was entered is also available. There's also an entirely new table, *pharmacy*, which provides a much richer picture for prescribed medications (formulary dose, dosing schedule, route, and so on).

Medication information are now available in detail, from physician prescription to drug manipulation and administration in our **6** fresh out of the oven tables: `emar`, `emar_detail`, `prescriptions`, `pharmacy`, `poe`, `poe_detail`.

&nbsp;  
## Is that all you got?

**NO** - MIMIC-IV is a very comprehensive database and there are many things to talk about!

Fortunately, @alistairewj has shared some more details about it in his recent tutorials at ACM CHIL 2020.
